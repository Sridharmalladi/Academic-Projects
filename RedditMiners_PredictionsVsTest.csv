530,"At the moment, it looks like NEISD is trying to do a live learning schedule, so the studentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s day is already scheduled out from 8-3 (30 minute lunch, 15 minute recess). If I had the choice, we would work much more flexibly so that we make progress, but can do it in a fun way. Ideally IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d love to be able to follow something similar to a Montessori method where studentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s learn through experience and can focus on subjects that interest them during enrichment time. 

I also know how important it is for kids to be able to move around while they learn, and not just sit in front of a computer. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to be able to make the assignments as fun as possible. More than likely during asynchronous learning time I will take the assignments and adapt them to be more interactive, even if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as simple as doing math problems on a small white board with a dry erase marker. I also have a big back yard so I plan on getting some backyard toys (soccer ball and goals, football, sidewalk chalk, etc)

543,"the thing is, there will always still be someone who will resort to the clothes hanger. A rape victim, someone who is impoverished and won't be able to travel out of state (because we all know Texas is on the path to a full ban), there are many other reasons. Just because BC is legal, and some states will keep abortion legal, doesn't mean that all women will have access to it. Not everyone will help these people, not all women have someone on their side.

If the term abortion is used in it's true umbrella state, it means any pregnancy ended PRIOR to being full term, the fetus and placenta being removed from the uterus. This includes medical abortions for the health of the mother (or potentially a twin baby if one baby is failing in health). This includes abortions for peoples with disabilities who are incapable of taking care of a child yet may have been abused, manipulated and tricked. This includes abortions for those who have been raped, regardless of age or mental capabilities. By saying -no- abortions and leaving the states up to determine what that means (and Texas doesn't care if you've been raped), then it's setting up a lot of vulnerable people up for failure and a lifetime of pain and suffering. All while the people who oppose abortion and rallied for it's ban shake their heads at yet another poor soul leeching out the system, while not offering not so much as a smile.

It's by no means my favorite, but the crime doesn't stand out any more than anywhere else, the rush hour traffic is generally better than other cities of equivalent size, the zoo is small but fun, seaworld has a park here, the children's museum is great, I've only seen one better (St. Louis).  The downsides to San Antonio are far and few between, the biggest being the amount of uninsured drivers, but a solid insurance policy will protect you from that.  This is one of the few areas growing economically, the price of housing is more akin to a small town, the locals are very nice and also despise the stereotypical example of poor gang affiliated Hispanic thugs.  (Which are no worse than any other gang presence in other cities).

I have heard many parents of white boys experience bullying though, not sure why but that seems like it would be a concern of mine if I had a son.  But I've spent quite a bit of time in Dallas and Houston, and San Antonio is more family oriented and cheaper, though I prefer the outlying areas around those cities over the area around SA.

As a younger man I did a lot of side work and consulting for different groups, but the pay was always at a lower rate than my corporate job. I've seen two replies now stating that a small scale operation should have equal compensation to the largest scale education systems. :( 

So if you were offered a position with a small church or home setting to teach only 4 children instead of 20+, you would need to make equal to a district position?  Or do you think more pay is required since you lose the TRS benefit? I understand the desire to not go backwards in your career, but the scope of work is significantly smaller, isn't it? Am I missing something major about the position I have not considered? 

One of my friends graduated a few years ago and finished her student classroom hours, but she is teaching at a church pre-school for just a couple of dollars over minimum wage. I guess I just had some wildly incorrect conclusions based off of the education friends I have on Facebook.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Russian MastersÃ¢â‚¬Â on Nov. 19-20, Ã¢â‚¬Å“BeethovenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœEmperorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ConcertoÃ¢â‚¬Â on Nov. 26-27, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Holidays at The MajesticÃ¢â‚¬Â on Dec. 18 have all been canceled by the Symphony Society of San Antonio, the board that oversees the orchestraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s operations.

According to Symphony spokesperson Kimberly Maldonado, Ã¢â‚¬Å“San Antonio Symphony Box Office representatives will contact all ticket holders directly over the phone in the coming days to ensure they understand next steps and all ticketing options.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Following the Sept. 27 declaration of a strike by the Musicians of the San Antonio Symphony, the season-opening concerts of Oct. 28-29 and Nov. 5-6 were also canceled, with musicians periodically leafleting and picketing outside their main performance venue, the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts.

The dispute deepens
---

The latest development in the ongoing dispute is a charge by the Symphony Society filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on Oct. 29, alleging bad-faith bargaining by the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) Local 23, which represents the musicians in contract negotiations for the national union.

The Symphony SocietyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charge follows an earlier NLRB charge filed by AFM Local 23 on Oct. 25, alleging that the Symphony Society has engaged in unfair labor practices and bad-faith bargaining. When management informed the union it was canceling musiciansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ health and other benefits on Oct. 28, the union added Ã¢â‚¬Å“Repudiation/Modification of ContractÃ¢â‚¬Â to its earlier charge.

John Ferguson, the attorney representing orchestra management, said the Symphony SocietyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charge is not a counter-charge but is wholly independent of the unionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earlier charge.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Even if the union hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t filed their charge, I think the symphony probably would have filed their own,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ferguson said.

A major part of the charge alleges that the union did Ã¢â‚¬Å“not [live] up to the letter and spirit of the partiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ agreement to first attempt to use interest based bargaining,Ã¢â‚¬Â and refused to accept mediation by Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service commissioners.

Interest-based bargaining (IBB), also known as mutual gains bargaining, is a negotiation strategy meant to avoid adversarial bargaining, opting instead for Ã¢â‚¬Å“consensus-seeking and cooperativeÃ¢â‚¬Â negotiations.

David Van Os, attorney for the musicians, said mediators present for the earlier IBB negotiation sessions showed bias toward management, in part because the musicians were not allowed to focus on the 80% pay cuts they had endured during the height of pandemic cancellations in 2020.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“When we were trying to explain the background leading up to here, one of those mediators told us that that was just all baggage and that she didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to hear about it,Ã¢â‚¬Â Van Os said.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“They want a mediator so badly, that they must think that a mediator will convince the union to agree to their demands,Ã¢â‚¬Â he added.

Ã¢â‚¬ËœRocks in their headÃ¢â‚¬â„¢
---

The Symphony Society charge further accuses the union of negotiating in bad faith, refusing to continue negotiations, and imposing conditions for a return to bargaining.

Van Os called the charge an attempt to deflect attention from the unionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earlier charge. Ã¢â‚¬Å“If theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re charging us in bad faith, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got rocks in their head.Ã¢â‚¬Â

The union has called for management to rescind the contract imposed on Sept. 26 before negotiations can continue. The contract matches managementÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“last, best, final offer,Ã¢â‚¬Â which reduces the number of full-time musicians in the orchestra from 71 to 42, fills 26 other positions with part-time musicians, and makes drastic wage cuts of 33% for full-timers and what union members have described as Ã¢â‚¬Å“poverty levelÃ¢â‚¬Â annual wages of $11,000 for part-timers.

Van Os said the two sides met last week for a grievance session outside the formal negotiations, and the union told management Ã¢â‚¬Å“if you will withdraw that [last, best, final offer] label Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and if you will agree to rescind the unilaterally imposed conditions, we will be happy to come back to the bargaining table. But weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not going to do it unless itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on an equal playing field.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ferguson, once an attorney for the NLRB in the 1980s, said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the way it works in bargaining. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not asking the union to call off their strike as a condition to return to the table.Ã¢â‚¬Â

He said management might well be willing to move away from its last, best, final offer, but nothing can be determined until the two sides return to negotiations.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll consider all proposals Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and hopefully arrive at some kind of mutually agreeable contract. Both sides are going to have to move Ã¢â‚¬â€ the Symphony realizes that they may have to move from their last best and final. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ They may very well move. But we wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know that until we get to the table and negotiate.Ã¢â‚¬Â

The law is clear, Ferguson said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t condition bargaining.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Ferguson said the imposed contract applies only to the third year of the original three-year contract negotiated in 2019 and does not bear on future contracts. But Van Os said agreeing to the imposed contract terms for even the remainder of the 2021-2022 season would prove disastrous for the symphony.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“We believe that we would never be able to get the symphony to get off of them if we agreed to them. They are completely intolerable. They will destroy the San Antonio symphony,Ã¢â‚¬Â Van Os said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“And it looks to me like right now, the board is trying to destroy the symphony. This is their doing, and it will be their historical legacy.Ã¢â‚¬Â",Yes,No,No,No,No,,Yes,No,Yes,No,No

I would think they would need a city administration willing to allow use or lease? the existing city fiber network; currently seeing little use.

That existing fiber network was conceived by and installed for CPS.  CPS is an entity of the City of San Antonio; and thus that network is publicly owned.

Little of this would affect *residential* services; but would bring Google Fiber / the rest of the net, etc to Agencies, libraries, schools, other public entities.   So I would think it would help Google's footprint or allow these agencies to fully utilize speeds offered by Google.

Other companies likely lobbied against municipal entities offering broadband services thus that network is mostly dark.

Also; bear in mind that Austin is just now getting widespread installs of the Google Service.  This is 2+ years after Google finalized that Austin would get the service.   They had to build out the ""huts"" and other infrastructure.

524,"&gt; Saying ""don't bother"" is a surefire way to ensure that no fibre network will ever be built in San Antonio.

Nonsense. Google would commission market studies that take into account things like household income and housing density, as well as their own *extensive* internal repository of ad/user data. The number/location of self-selected respondents to a web ""form"" proves nothing. Half of those people won't live in the same place in 5 years, so even if Google miraculously decided this weekend to bless San Antonio with fiber, it'd take longer than 5 years to start offering service here, because this city's so vast. What matters is demographics - Is there a critical mass of people in the market who are likely to be interested in purchasing the product and who can afford it? Do they live close enough together that we can get them the fiber cost-effectively?

Google is probably keenly aware that San Antonio *already* has a Texas-based [overbuild](http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/21/local/me-15136) TV/broadband provider that COULDN'T MAKE THE ECONOMICS WORK to expand its territory outside of Loop 410. I live in a neighborhood outside of 410 that has been wired for Grande. All they'd have to do is connect a trunk line to it and my neighborhood could be in their territory without having to bury a single cable. They can't make the economics work to do that. To me, THAT is the biggest reason we won't be anywhere near the top of the list if/when they expand the project. If a company that knows this city's quirky demographics couldn't make a go of overbuild service, then this probably isn't a good place to try an overbuild.

If you don't mind driving out to Boerne you can get trained out there and save tons of cash. The airspace is not controlled so you don't have to waste so much time and money waiting around on the taxiway and getting routed out of the SAT Class C airspace. Google 5C1 (the airport code). 

If that is not an option then check out a school at Stinson municipal. That is a towered airport but it's own Class D which is at the south edge of the busy airspace so you can get out quickly. 

This all matters because you pay for the plane and the instructor by the hour and you can spend 30+ minutes just taxiing and flying far enough away from KSAT to do your lessons. If money was no object, it does at least have the advantage of honing your radio skills very well.

Public libraries will be your best friend to for good free resources and YouTube. Reddit is also another great source.

I have a friend who the sells you just took a security Plus and got a government he's making over 75k. Since he used to sell oil rig supplies.

I know you said you were looking to CDL license. Might want to try short term hauls like Laredo to San Antonio Houston maybe some parts of Louisiana. It is an expensive career choice I will say that I don't know that much about the field though so maybe ask on Reddit sure there's a form. 

I would suggest you just look at your community colleges see what they have to offer for electrician, mechanic, networking. See what they have for medical field surgical technician you can make a pretty good cash with that. You should be eligible for something with electrician for financial aid since it's a big demand.

For networking and cyber security San Antonio is a capital for that in Texas. Well then since the city is growing so fast electricians will be needed so you'll always have work with that. Same thing with plumbing, physical therapy people will always be getting old.

HVAC is a good demand stuff as well. 
Check out usajobs.gov you might find a job there that you might want to try.

100,"I live in this apartment complex. And I definitely wouldn't recommend it. In the six months I've lived here, we've had a break-in on a Sunday during the day when we weren't home, a shooting that happened a couple of buildings away with no details that I know of on it. And we also had another notice that there was a shooting where someone fired a gun into the air.

On top of that, it's really not a very aesthetic place to live. They've promised to put in grass in the lower area, and it still turns into nothing but mud every time it rains and looks terrible. Yes, the parking is also pretty bad during the evenings.  Also, the apartments are quite old. Most were built in the 70s, except for the one in the front building where it burned a year or two ago and they completely renovated it.  (They say that some of their apartments are renovated, and really this is the only one that I've seen that is. Because it burned down.) if you do a Google search for it you'll find it. 

I still have half of a year left on my lease in this place. And I definitely won't be renewing it. Their maintenance team tries hard, but they take 2 to 3 days to show up. When our apartment was broken into, the door latches were replaced but they didn't fit properly, and every time there was any kind of humidity in the air, our door wouldn't lock easily from the outside and it took them a couple of days to get here. So I almost had to risk not locking my door when I would leave. 

There are some other things that I've noticed about this place, like the stray cats, the garbage area that just sits outside, but take my advice and look somewhere else to live. It's not terrible, it's definitely not the cheapest place, but there are a lot of other nicer places that I have seen around here. The only reason I moved in here is that I was looking for a place with very little advance notice and it was the only place that had apartments available. ",Yes,No,Yes,No,No,,Yes,No,No,No,No

I am watching the issues with the maps in OS 6...Granted they did this as Google (not a bad thing this is a predictable and they are a business) will begin monetizing access to the maps.  For x million iPhones in circulation; this will add up for Apple.  The new maps are not detailed in some spots as Google ones.

However; through sheer coincidence I installed the full Garmin app to my phone with turn by turn; which has walking, driving and public transit directions; the latter which the new maps lack.   This will affect me less; so I guess I am sort of wait and see on the OS6 but leaning toward upgrading when the download appears; for now.

Not all trump supporters are white supremacists but white supremacists are much more likely to be a Trump supporter then a Biden supporter. Violent and non-violent white supremacist groups alike are very vocal Trump supporters. 

If thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a massive Trump rally, the chance that one or more violent white supremacist is there is higher then any other public gathering (aside from a straight up kkk meeting).

I have been called a kike multiple times while walking my dog while wearing my Jewish star necklace, I have had swastikas painted on my door more then once. When I was living in the Boston area two years ago, significantly more liberal, there was attempted arson on two rabbiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s houses just 10 minutes away from me. Just recently, a rabbi was stabbed in a hate crime near my old Boston neighborhood. A group of white supremacists yelled Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Jews will not replace usÃ¢â‚¬Â while counter protesting in Charlottesville just a few years ago. The Tree of Life synagogue shooting was the largest massacre of Jews in the USA. All of this and more happened during TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presidency. 

Do I know that every person perpetrating those hate crimes was a Trump supporter? No, I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be certain. But hateful people felt emboldened during his presidency and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s terrifying to me.

What I question is why build your own datacenter to do this crunching? Just cause I want to use web-based email do I go and spend millions on a datacenter, and hire software developers to do this? Nah, I just sign up for GMail.

GMail is an example of Software as a Service, but Amazon and countless other providers offer Infrastructure as a Server (servers, storage, etc) either on-demand, or you can rent a base load of physical servers and scale out with virtual (cloud) servers.

Building datacenters is not CPS's bag. Hell, not even Netflix thinks it's their bag...all of Netflix is run on servers billed based on hourly usage! Netflix does not run datacenters. I'm curious how someone like CPS needs their own physical datacenters when the biggest names in technology, whose critical business run on datacenter, do not run their own datacenters.

The best part of this is that a cloud/dedicated provider will manage power, cooling, upgrades--all of this administrative overhead--is handled by them. And it's scalable, meaning you can use 10 servers for your day-to-day operations and pay only for, say, 30 more servers for the week that you do billing.

On top of that, no one who's sensible builds datacenters in south Texas. Cooling is expensive, and our baseload electric here is non-renewable and expensive natural gas. The consensus is the industry is to build in areas that are cooler, and where hydroelectric is the predominant generation source. 

&gt; Google and Facebook tend to build their data centers in remote, optimum locations like the Columbia River Valley, where power is cheap, or in central Oregon where the cool nights and high desert climate aid in the fight to keep densely packed computer equipment from overheating."" --[source: Information Week](http://www.informationweek.com/how-to-build-a-modern-data-center/d/d-id/1097407)

And it's scalable, meaning you can use 10 servers for your day-to-day operations and pay only for, say, 30 more servers for the week that you do billing.

On top of that, no one who's sensible builds datacenters in south Texas. Cooling is expensive, and our baseload electric here is non-renewable and expensive natural gas. The consensus is the industry is to build in areas that are cooler, and where hydroelectric is the predominant generation source. 

&gt; Google and Facebook tend to build their data centers in remote, optimum locations like the Columbia River Valley, where power is cheap, or in central Oregon where the cool nights and high desert climate aid in the fight to keep densely packed computer equipment from overheating."" --[source: Information Week](http://www.informationweek.com/how-to-build-a-modern-data-center/d/d-id/1097407)

**==TWC==**
 * Pro:
 ** Cable Reliable
 ** Depending on service you don't need boxes for every TV
 ** Internet speeds are decent.
 ** Under $200 for ""all the things"".
 * Con:
 ** Phone service was horrible quality.
 ** Channels at times took 30s or longer to change (this is why I changed to U-Verse)
 ** Bad patch jobs for outlet work
 ** Left outside boxes and connectors open and exposed to elements.

**==U-Verse==**
 * Pro:
 ** Faster than TWC when changing the channels
 ** Decent customer service from time to time
 ** Good phone quality, great download speeds
 ** Good DVR interface 
 ** Nice phone application for scheduling shows.
 * Con:
 ** Requires a box for EVERY TV and they charge for each one (be careful here they said they were free [online and via phone] they were not)
 ** Right now I'm experiencing a problem where I can't upload several photos to imgur, facebook, or flickr using drag and drop (anyone else having this problem). It's been a week and still no fix after multiple calls.
 ** Over $200 for ""all the things"".

Having said all that, your choice of provider will most likely be dependent on where you live. You'll probably only get one, or if you're really lucky, two choices.

This full-day Pre-K Academy will employ highly-trained teachers who will provide an enhanced curriculum with a Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math focus. Children will also enjoy physical education, music and library services, as well as a healthy breakfast and lunch.

For the convenience of parents, early drop off will be available, and after-school care will be offered for an additional cost. There will also be convenient bus hubs located throughout the District for bus-eligible students.

Seats will be available for traditional Pre-K qualifying students, as well as non-qualifying students.

Through NEISD's Tradition of Excellence, our goal is to provide a high-quality, full-day, Pre-K program that is a good match for your child and family.
